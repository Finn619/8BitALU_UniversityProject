# 8BitALU_UniversityProject
This repository contains the design files and report, along with a  README for the 8-bit ALU I designed as part of my digital design course.

This project aims to explore the implementation of one of a computer's most foundational components as part of a hierarchical design for digital systems, which can be  integrated into further combinational and sequential circuitry.

Below, is the handwritten and drawn planning and design done beforehand for the initial 4-bit ALU which was then scaled into the 8-bit ALU.

This last comparison operation uses a shortcut by playing on the fact that it shares a portion of its opcode with the subtract operation, which we can then allow the flag to be read and linked to the output, negating the need for extra logic.

The design files can all be found in the main directory.
